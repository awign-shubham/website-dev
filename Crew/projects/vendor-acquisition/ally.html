<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p> In this project, you will be trained and will be responsible for a very important role of vendor sourcing for a 
growing manufacturing start-up <a href=http://ally.work target="_blank">Ally.Work</a>. They are borne with a mission to help small and medium manufacturers grow their business. They act as sales and marketing team for manufacturing 
organizations, starting with Metal Fabrication and Packaging Material Manufacturing.<br/><br/>

On their web platform, they collect verified Request for Quotation (RFQ) from brands looking for packaging 
suppliers. A quotation refers to a formal statement describing the estimated cost for a particular job or service. 
They match these RFQs to appropriate vendors and ask for quotations on the items. The quotations 
that come from vendors are passed to the seeker for his approval. Once cleared, the vendors can set up a 
meeting with the seeker and close the deal and terms of payment.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3> 
<p>For an RFQ of manufacturing 50,000 dropper bottles (for eye drops) of 15ml for the purpose of 
storing deodorant, your task will be to get quotations containing the price of these bottles from vendors who 
deal in this sector.</p>

<h2>Steps to be followed</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Thoroughly understand the requirement for which the quotations have to be procured. Such a
		requirement is technically known as Request for Quotation (RFQ). You will be trained on every 
		aspect of understanding the RFQ.</li>

	<li>Find the list of relevant vendors by searching through appropriate keywords on various online marketplaces such as Indiamart and Tradeindia. In order to ensure that only relevant vendors appear in the search list, you must ensure that you have a good understanding of the RFQ.</li>

	<li>You need to call the vendors one by one, explain the requirement to them, resolve their queries 
		and get them to send the quotation for the RFQ. You would be trained on the way you need to 
		talk to vendors and also given a set of steps that you need to follow throughout your 
		engagement with the vendors.</li>

	<li>You would be required to maintain a database while engaging with the vendors. The framework 
		for the same would be provided.</li>

	<li>You will be compensated with your stipend once the quotations are validated.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Skill Set</h2>

<p>Engaging with correct vendors and getting the desired quotations is an art which would implore you to
bring in the following skills and show them in the real world.</p>
<ul>
	<li>People Engagement Skills</li>
	<li>Good Verbal Communication Skills</li>
	<li>Leadership Skills</li>
	<li>Business Awareness</li>
	<li>Project Management Skills</li>
	<li>Problem Solving</li>
	<li>Critical Thinking</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Completion Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
	<li> The price of Rs 3000 corresponds to successful execution of the project for 5 RFQs and you need to get 8 quotations for each RFQ.</li>
	<li>In case of unsuccessful execution of the project, the stipend will be calculated based on your performance. You will be given Rs 75 for each valid quotation that you bring, provided you bring at least 3 quotations for each RFQ.</li>
	<li>Good performers will be given the opportunity to take on the responsibility of more RFQs and
		would be paid a better amount for each RFQ they complete.</li>
</ul>
